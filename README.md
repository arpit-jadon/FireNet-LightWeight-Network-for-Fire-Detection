# FireNet-LightWeight-Network-for-Fire-Detection
> A Specialized Lightweight Fire & Smoke Detection Model for Real-Time IoT Applications

Research paper submitted to TENCON-2019, for consideration and possible inclusion, in the conference proceedings.

In our paper we showed results on two datasets:
- A self created dataset with images randomly sampled from our self-shot fire and non-fire
videos.
- Foggia's dataset (used for testing), which is available here (https://mivia.unisa.it/datasets/video-analysis-datasets/fire-detection-dataset/).

The following is the link for our dataset:
